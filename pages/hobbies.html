            <h2>Basketball</h2>
            <p>The first sport I was introduced to was football, and while I did enjoy it; it was just never something that I wanted to do.</p>
            <p>I honestly cannot remember when I first watched basketball. It had something to do with watching clips of the 90s Chicago Bulls. I almost instantly fell in love and it became a huge part of my life.</p>
            <p>I played from elementary, all through middle school, and the first few years of high school. However, I had a lingering back injury that I never got checked out, and it would cause me to miss a lot of games. 
               Once I did get it checked out, I was told that I had fractured my spine in a few differnt places and would need to have surgery. The surgery went well and I was able to recover relatively well,
               but my competitive basketball career was over for the forseeable future. I still shoot around every now and then, but it is no longer one of the main focuses of my life.</p>

            <h2>Writing</h2>
            <p>Somewhere in the middle of my basketball phase, I found out that I had an interest in writing.</p>
            <p>During the fourth grade I was asked to participate in an academic writing competition. I agreed but I never really took it seriously, even while doing the competition it wasn't on the front of my mind.
               However, to my surprise, I won first place in the contest. That's when I started to like it more and take it more seriously.</p>
            <p>Throughout high school I continued to write for academic competitions, and now I still do it from time to time just as a hobby.</p>

            <h2>Programming</h2>
            <p>The first time I was introduced to programming was when I was put into computer science during my first year of high school.</p>
            <p>I didn't really find it that interesting though until my junior year of high school, I started with Java, learning the basics and writing some basic programs.
               When I went to college we started with python, then moved into some C++, but we never really got too deep into either.</p>
            <p>After spending a year in college I decided to go another route and I started trying to find a career in web development.

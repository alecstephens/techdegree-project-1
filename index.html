          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>I've always been into technology. From a young age I knew that I wanted my career to involve some sort of technolgy.</p>
          <p>This eventually led me to discover computer science. In which I learned that I was very interested in Web Development.</p>
          <p>After going through one year of college, I decided to go a somewhat more self-taught route and look into other options.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h2>Hobbies</h2>
          <p>While a lot of my focus is on learning web development, I do have a life outside of it.</p>
          <p> Some various hobbies I have include:</p>  
          <ul>
            <li>Running</li>
            <li>Reading</li>
            <li>Writing</li>
          </ul>
          <p>These are just a few things that I enjoy doing in my spare time.</p>
        </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>When it comes to computer science and web development, there are so many things that I want to learn.</p>
        <p>Some languages/frameworks that I want to master are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>React</li>
          <li>Node.Js</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Of course eventually I would like to know a lot more than just this. However, in order to get to that point, I need to start somewhere</p>
